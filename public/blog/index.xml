      <title>Debug Slab Memory Corruption via SLUB debug</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/blog/debug-slub-memory/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory corruption can occur due to various bugs or defects: Uninitialized Memory
Reads (UMR), Use After Free (UAF), Use After Return (UAR), double-free, memory
leakage, or illegal Out Of Bounds (OOB) accesses that attempt to work upon (read/write/
execute) illegal memory regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since memory is dynamically allocated and freed via the kernel&amp;rsquo;s engine – the
page allocator. This can lead to serious wastage (internal fragmentation) of memory.
To mitigate this, the slab allocator (or slab cache) is layered upon it, serving two
primary tasks – providing fragments of pages efficiently (within the kernel, allocation
requests for small pieces of memory, from a few bytes to a couple of kilobytes, tend to be
very common), and serving as a cache for commonly used data structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Linux Kernel Mentorship Program</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Linux for the last 2 years. At first, I was amazed how perfectly and smoothly it worked on my computer. Since then, I started using Linux as my primary machine for development work. Last summer, I gained interest in C. The Summer Application was open, but I decided not to apply and worked on improving my proficiency in C. The Fall &amp;lsquo;25 application opened in August, and I appiled. The prerequisites for the mentorship included some basic tasks like building and booting the Linux Kernel, writing the first &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; kernel module, learning to decode a stack trace, and changing the kernel version in source code and booting with that change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-to-write-your-first-linux-kernel-driver-using-the-misc-device-framework&#34;&gt;How to Write Your First Linux Kernel Driver Using the Misc Device Framework&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explains how to write a simple Linux kernel driver using the misc device framework. The misc framework is a good starting point because it automatically creates the device node when the driver registers, reducing setup complexity. In this example driver, a PID written from user space is stored in the kernel, and reading from the device triggers the driver to look up and display information about the corresponding task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Install Ubuntu Server on Qemu</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;installation-of-ubuntu-server-on-qemu-x86_64&#34;&gt;Installation of ubuntu server on qemu-x86_64&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At First I want to run the custom modules on linux. But this is something that is not good to do on host machine. So i searched a lot of stuff. Tinkering with buildroot, after some days i was able to run the build on qemu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But i found out build actually didn’t have my basic tool like &lt;code&gt;gnu make&lt;/code&gt;. Everytime i try to do something i need to find particular tool on &lt;code&gt;menuconfig&lt;/code&gt; then make the build again. Learning was so slow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
