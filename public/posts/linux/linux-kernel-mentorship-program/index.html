Since then, I started using Linux as my primary machine for development work. Last summer, I gained interest in C. The Summer Application was open, but I decided not to apply and worked on improving my proficiency in C. The Fall ‘25 application opened in August, and I appiled. The prerequisites for the mentorship included some basic tasks like building and booting the Linux Kernel, writing the first “hello world” kernel module, learning to decode a stack trace, and changing the kernel version in source code and booting with that change.\nSomehow, my application was accepted ;-). At first, the Linux Kernel seemed quite difficult to understand what was going on. We were initially told to choose two subsystems to work on.\nHowever, I checked the syzbot website and randomly chose a bug from the trace subsystem, related to the kernel ring buffer and somehow I ended up sending a patch for this fix.\nBut I personally advise not to do this.\nI also tried to solve other syzbot bugs, but couldn’t, mainly because I wasn’t aware of the details – what was going on under the hood. So, I paused those attempts for some time. David Hunter first told us to solve the easy fixes, like warning fixes in the kselftest subsystem and kernel build warnings with W=1, and working on them is also quite easy for a beginner. Backporting can also be considered as beginner task – see Hanne-Lotta’s Blog - link.\nThere are some key details that you have to look out for when working on kernel development, like sending the patch with a clear explanation: what the patch was for, what and how it is fixing the bug, and why you think your approach is right.\nThe Patch Submission Flow Create the Patch: git format-patch HEAD~1 Check the Patch for Typographical Errors and Format Correctness: (Run the check and then apply fixes if needed)\n./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --fix-inplace hello.patch ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --fix-inplace -f --fix hello.patch Find the List of Maintainers related to that Subsystem: ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --separator=, --no-rolestats hello.patch Sending the patch git send-email --to= --cc= hello.patch (Note: Replace and with the actual emails obtained from get_maintainer.pl.)\nNote: Always make sure to double check the patch before sending it to the mailing list. I will recommend first sending the patch to your email or use git send-email using the --dry-run option.\nWriting a Changelog for Previous Versions:\nAlways write the changelog in patches except for the first version. see: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20251106095532.15185-1-ankitkhushwaha.linux@gmail.com/\nMailing list Preference Each subsystem have different preference. for example: Networking subsystem: netdev\nFor the kselftest subsystem, it is helpful to mention the compiler details with which you are getting the error/warning. Installing the uapi header before compiling the test.\nmake headers_install see: discussion\nPatch accepted During the mentorship total of 7 patch was accepted in mainline kernel.\n0384c8ea96bfe49e82e624e53bfd5f80c3230ea9 selftests/mm/uffd: initialize char variable to Null af7273cc7ae01f5b3e34e62f59588ce79fe50f79 selftests/net: initialize char variable to null 3b12a53b64d0c86cf68cab772bd4137e451b17a5 selftest/mm: fix pointer comparison in mremap_test 6ae0f2072768fb3db7846cee08b611a96310930d docs: parse-headers.rst: Fix a typo 216158f063fe24fb003bd7da0cd92cd6e2c4d48b selftests/user_events: fix type cast for write_index packed member in perf_test afb8f6567a5b4bb4e673608048939fef854b8709 selftest: net: fix socklen_t type mismatch in sctp_collision test de4cbd704731778a2dc833ce5a24b38e5d672c05 ring buffer: Propagate __rb_map_vma return value to caller Tips and Tools One of the things that I learned is that whenever you are writing a patch for a fix, check the previous commits for that file before writing the patch header to ensure consistency with the file’s existing style.\nOne difficulty I was experiencing was navigating the codebase and finding the definition for a particular macro in VS Code – it was taking too much time to process. However, I later found cscope that also works fine.\nUsing Cscope for Code Navigation:\ncd linux/ # Generate Cscope Database: make cscope \\-j8 # This will generate files like ls csocpe* cscope.files cscope.out cscope.out.in cscope.out.po # Enter Cscope Interactive Mode cscope -d cscope works fine. The Sublime Text editor also works well for Code Navigation. Additionally, Sublime Merge was helpful for quickly finding the previous commits of a particular file.\nClosing Thoughts\nThe learning was very rewarding, especially the Office Hours meetings and Discord discussions. I learned that kernel development and becoming a kernel hacker isn’t an easy task that you can just pick up quickly. It requires consistent, dedicated effort. We need to acquire a deeper understanding of systems programming, architecture, and a willingness to troubleshoot complex issues.\nIt’s certainly a long but ultimately rewarding journey. I also learned about the development cycle of the Linux kernel. This program was a strong beginning, and the work will continue.\nI will recommend this mentorship program to anyone interested in Linux kernel development. You’ll learn the basics and find out if kernel development interests you in the long term. What I find most valuable is that you get a feel for the supportive open source community.\nI am very thankful to Shuah, David and Khalid for this wonderful mentorship program.\n",

</code></pre><p><code>cscope</code> works fine. The Sublime Text editor also works well for Code Navigation. Additionally, Sublime Merge was helpful for quickly finding the previous commits of a particular file.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>The learning was very rewarding, especially the Office Hours meetings and Discord discussions. I learned that kernel development and becoming a kernel hacker isn&rsquo;t an easy task that you can just pick up quickly. It requires consistent, dedicated effort. We need to acquire a deeper understanding of systems programming, architecture, and a willingness to troubleshoot complex issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly a long but ultimately rewarding journey. I also learned about the development cycle of the Linux kernel. This program was a strong beginning, and the work will continue.</p>
<p>I will recommend this mentorship program to anyone interested in Linux kernel development. You&rsquo;ll learn the basics and find out if kernel development interests you in the long term. What I find most valuable is that you get a feel for the supportive open source community.</p>
<p>I am very thankful to Shuah, David and Khalid for this wonderful mentorship program.</p>
